<h3 id="z-sparkle-party-and-drag-race-to-end-alzheimer-s-">Z’Sparkle Party and Drag Race to End Alzheimer’s!*</h3>
<p>It all started in 2010 when a group of friends began talking about hosting some sort of a party to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter. “Z’Sparkle” was decided upon for the theme because, in the amount of time it takes an average sparkler to burn, 67 seconds, another person will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and another life’s light will begin to dim. In addition, to honor the sparkle the victims of Alzheimer&#39;s once had, the sparkle in their eyes; the sparkle of their love and talents and spirit and the sparkle that their lives brought to all the lives they touched, it was decided that guests would need to wear sparkly dresses.</p>
<p>Which prompted someone to ask, “Sparkly dresses? For the guys too?” He proceeded to share the story of a lost Super Bowl bet. Early in 2010, a friendly wager was made between friends – one an avid Saints fan, who lives in New Orleans; the other a dedicated Colts fan, who lives in Zionsville. The good natured bet was of the “dress like a fan” nature. The loser was a walk down the Brick Street of Zionsville. If the Saints fan lost, bib overalls and a Colts jersey would be her attire. But, if the Colts fan lost, a dazzling dress and Saints attire would be in order. As you know, the Colts lost.</p>
<p>“So,” questioned another, “If another guy walked with you, and maybe jogged a little, it would be sort of a ‘drag race’, right?”</p>
<p>Z’Sparkle Party Drag Race to End Alzheimer’s was born - a light hearted and fun event designed to bring people in our community together to raise awareness about this devastating disease while raising money to support the Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter.</p>
<p>With the generous partnership of Zionsville Meadows, the idea quickly became a reality. In short order, it grew into an event including brave gentleman from right here in our own community, including merchants, business owners and town leaders – all who agreed to don a dress, collect donations and “run” down Main Street in the name of a very good cause. The first year’s event drew large crowds and raised over $12,000 for the Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter.  Now in its 6th year, Z’Sparkle has raised a total of over $150,000 and those totals continue to grow!</p>
<p>We may laugh, dress funny and be light-hearted, but our goal is serious and it’s sincere – a world without Alzheimer’s – a world where the sparkle never dims.</p>
