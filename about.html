<h3 id="z-sparkle-party-and-drag-race-to-end-alzheimer-s-">Z’Sparkle Party and Drag Race to End Alzheimer’s!</h3>
<p>It all started in 2010 when a group of friends began talking about hosting some sort of a party to raise money for the Alzheimer’s Association. “Z’Sparkle” was decided upon for the theme because, in the amount of time it takes an average sparkler to burn – less than 70 seconds – another person will be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and another life’s light will begin to dim. In addition, to honor the sparkle the victims of Alzheimer&#39;s once had, the sparkle in their eyes; the sparkle of their love and talents and spirit and the sparkle that their lives brought to all the lives they touched, it was decided that guests would need to wear sparkly dresses.</p>
<p>Which prompted someone to ask, “Sparkly dresses? For the guys too?” He proceeded to share the story of a lost Super Bowl bet. Early in 2010, a friendly wager was made between friends – one an avid Saints fan, who lives in New Orleans; the other a dedicated Colts fan, who lives in Zionsville. The good natured bet was of the “dress like a fan” nature. The bet was a walk down the Brick Street of Zionsville. If the Saints fan lost, bib overalls and a Colts jersey would be her attire. But, if the Colts fan lost, a dazzling dress and Saints attire would be in order. As you know, the Colts lost.</p>
<p>“So,” questioned another, “If another guy walked with you, and maybe jogged a little, it would be sort of a ‘drag race’, right?”</p>
<p>Z’Sparkle Party Drag Race to End Alzheimer’s was born - a light hearted and fun event designed to bring people in our community together to raise awareness about this devastating disease while raising money to support the Alzheimer’s Association.</p>
<p>With the generous partnership of Zionsville Meadows, the idea quickly became a reality. In short order, it grew into an event including brave gentleman from right here in our community, including merchants, business owners and town leaders – all who agreed to don a dress, collect donations and “run” down Main Street in the name of a very good cause. The first year’s event drew large crowds and raised over $12,000 for the Alzheimer’s Association Greater Indiana Chapter, the 2011 event raised over $27,000. The 2012 event topped $30,000 and last year&#39;s total topped $50,000!  We exceeded our goal of ending 2013 by tipping the scales at over $100,000 for the history of the event to date and look forward to growing that number this year!</p>
<p>We may laugh and dress funny and be light-hearted, but our goal is serious and it’s sincere – a world without Alzheimer’s – a world where the sparkle never dims.</p>

		<p>I have been wearing sparkly dresses since I popped out of the womb.  I probably was wearing one when my mother, Sater Ryder, “made” me walk to a home on an adjacent neighborhood street and introduce myself to the new kid my age. That kid, Amy Lacy, a cute little blonde in braids, is a co-founder of Z’Sparkle.  I handled the invitation with my typical aplomb.</p>
<p>Anne: “My Mom wants me to ask you to play.”<br>Amy Lacy: “Well, I guess so.”</p>
<p>As memory serves, Amy had on roller skates.  Just sayin’.</p>
<p>We’ve been playing together off and on, (mostly on) ever since.<br>Instant friends, our mothers were sometimes the angels of our bond. When my mother battled terminal brain cancer, Amy’s home, a short walk through the back yard, became a refuge and Jackie Lacy a secondary maternal source of comfort and care for me.</p>
<p>Years later, when Jackie was in the throes of her Alzheimer’s battle, Amy at her daily side, Jackie lifted from the fog one evening long enough to get a twinkle of recognition in her eye when Amy and I sat together. Jackie perked up considerably and said, “You girls go!” Go play! We did.</p>
<p>Our mothers always supported our friendship even when life, families and illness got in the way of it. Now that we are older and smarter, it is high time to don our sparkly dresses and turn the tables.</p>
<p>What an inspired idea this was.  We all get to play in the best way we know how. We have almost unspeakable fun in Main Street. We throw caution to the wind. Men wear high heels and sparkled dresses and women wear tuxes and tails. We remember and we forget. And most of all—love and laughter abounds as we raise money for Alzheimer’s research in the hope of ending suffering.</p>
<p>I am a part of this for obvious reasons. Amy asked. It is extremely personal. This is for Amy and Jackie. It is for my dear friend and for both my mothers whose voices ring in my ears.</p>
<p>It is time to come out and play.</p>

<li>is a member of the Indiana Broadcast Hall of Fame and maintains a freelance affiliation with WTHR-TV.</li>
<li>her reporting has taken her to war zones and put her with peacemakers.</li>
<li>shewas granted the last extensive interview given by Mother Teresa.</li>
<li>her stories of “Hope to Tell” earned 16 Regional Emmys Awards and five national honors for excellence in television. </li>
<li>she and her husband Kevin have a daughter, Jennifer Teresa, who is in high school.</li>
</ul>

		<p>It’s a privilege to be a part of the Z’Sparkle event with my friend, Anne Ryder. The Z’Sparkle team couldn’t get me to put on a dress and high heels for the last two Drag Races, but I’ve seen firsthand the toll Alzheimer’s takes on a family. My grandfather lived with the disease, and my own Dad has been diagnosed with early onset Dementia. Ted will be 82 in October and I am grateful to have him living with our family here in Zionsville.</p>
